# HS2-Firmware Patched

Factory firmware can be found here: https://www.ailunce.com/Support/HS2/Software

How the firmware was patched can be found here https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing

The following HS2 Firmware is patched to change the "user setup" to the hidden "factory setup" user account.

By flashing one of the following firmware file(s) to your HS2 radio it is then possible to navigate to the "SET" menu and hold down the "PA" button
then entering the pin of "000000" When exiting the SET menu and the again navigating into "SET" you should see the new factory menu shown in the following video: https://youtu.be/i6csYBGsueE
