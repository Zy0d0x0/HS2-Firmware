# HS2-Firmware Patched


How the firmware was patched can be found here: https://zy0d0x0.github.io/HS2-Reversing/

Factory firmware can be found here: https://www.ailunce.com/Support/HS2/Software

This patched firmware is no longer needed as all the pin numbers where found within the software and firmware.

* Factory Pin: 200510 
* Agent Pin: 685911 
* User Pin: 000000 

The password for HS2 Software V1 Beta login is 200510

But if you still would like to try the patched firmware to change the "user setup" to the hidden "factory setup" user account this can be achived by flashing one of the following firmware file(s) to your HS2 radio it is then possible to navigate to the "SET" menu and hold down the "PA" button
then entering the pin of "000000" When exiting the SET menu and the again navigating into "SET" you should see the new factory menu shown in the following video: https://youtu.be/i6csYBGsueE


If you would also like a Wheel for the HS2 the following project can be found here https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Wheel


Q900 1.4.5 Firmware is just a re-pack of the original DFU file as it fails to load into DFuse Demo. All i have done is extract the bin the re-add it
to a new DFU file.
